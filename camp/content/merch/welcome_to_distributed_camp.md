Distributed Camp is a unique event meant to highlight technologies which are changing the future of the Internet to empower users with new means of creating, hosting, and distributing content.


## The Goal
We wish for this to be an accessible, safe, and fun experience for all participants.
As much as is os is possible, we want participants to be able to engage in hands-on activities so they can achieve a firm grasp of the current capabilities of each featured project. We also hope that along the way, new groups and connections can be formed as we all explore this experience together.

## Other Thoughts
Some basic community principles we wish to impart:
1. Treat each other with patience and kindness.
2. Share openly and without expectation.
3. If you don't have something nice to say, it is better to keep it to yourself.
4. Make the improvements you wish to see in the world.
5. Learn by doing.
