Distributed Camp General Code of Conduct & Confidentiality Agreement

# **Ignorance is not an acceptable excuse for conduct that results in harassment.**

# Scope

The Distributed Camp Code of Conduct applies to all members, event attendees, partners, sponsors,
exhibitors, media, and representatives of Distributed Camp paid or unpaid (referred to hereafter as
“representatives”), in any context in which a reasonable observer might deem the individual to
be acting as an agent or representative of Distributed Camp. This includes, but is not limited to,
events, streams, competitions, emails, instant messaging, articles, blogs, forums, and
comments on news articles and social media platforms.

If a topic isn’t covered in this policy and you are unsure as to whether or not it is allowed,
please contact Distributed Camp leadership. Should you have any questions regarding this policy,
feel free to contact the [leadership team](mailto:distributed.camp.leadership@bimo.studio).

- Many event venues are shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all
patrons of these venues

organizers on-site if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.

# Special Note on Defamation & Harassment

Distributed Camp believes our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are
committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all. Representatives
may not make statements that defame any of the following classes, regardless of the
applicability of the class to the person being defamed:

- Race
- Color
- Religion
- Nationality/Ancestry
- Sex
- Gender identity or expression
- Age
- Mental or physical disability
- Medical condition
- Sexual orientation

Statements referencing a specific individual without reference to a class are permitted.
Colorful, crude, and vulgar language that
does not defame any of the above classes is explicitly permitted. Other forms of harassment
that may warrant corrective actions include impersonation, threats, and the misuse of reports
regarding violations of this policy.

# **Ignorance is not an acceptable excuse for conduct that results in harassment.**

Sexual violence and exploitation are strictly prohibited. Examples include, but are not limited
to:

- Sexual assault and molestation, or content that encourages or promotes it
- Unsolicited/unwanted offers, solicitation, demands, bribes, threats, or blackmail for
sexual content and services
- Any nudity, sexual content that involves minors, appears to involve minors, or
depictions of minors, or content that encourages or promotes pedophilia
Actions or statements of a sexual or suggestive nature made by a representative about an
individual, whether addressed to that individual or to a third party, will be considered
harassment if they occur repeatedly or occur after said individual has indicated that they should
cease. Polite, non-public, non-repeated advances are permitted.

# Reporting Violations & Repercussions

If you suspect a violation has occurred, send a recording/screenshot & any other supporting
information (including written accounts of events) to [distributed.camp.conduct@bimo.studio](mailto:distributed.camp.conduct@bimo.studio). We will
prioritize reports with evidence. If the violation occurs during an event, please speak with the
leadership staff on site for more immediate action. In cases of sexual assault or harassment, we
acknowledge it’s often difficult to come forward, but need your help to build a safe community
for everyone.

If you feel that the conduct or harassment in question rises to a legal claim or to a crime, we
encourage you to seek help from an attorney or your local law enforcement. Specific physical
threats or acts should be reported to your local law enforcement immediately.

All conduct violation decisions are determined solely by Distributed Camp leadership, based on a
review of information provided. Violation of this policy may result in action up to and including
termination of membership status, removal from community social channels, banishment from
future events, and escalating the matter to appropriate platform providers (e.g. Twitch) for
review. Any decisions made by the platform provider is independent of actions taken by
Distributed Camp and at their sole discretion. On such occasions, Distributed Camp reserves the right to
make public statements addressing the violator and/or their actions/statements for the
purposes of damage control.

Additionally, the decision actions made by Distributed Camp leadership may result in referral to
another appropriate authority for review for possible violation of State and Federal statutes
depending on the severity of the report.

To appeal any corrective action taken, you may respond with supporting information to the
communication that was used to inform you of the action.

Individuals will not be retaliated against for filing a complaint and/or assisting in a complaint or
investigation process. Further, we will not tolerate or permit retaliation by representatives
against the initial filer or anyone assisting in the investigation.

Always report a violation of your stream platform’s Terms of Service, Rules of Conduct, or
Community Guidelines when you see it occur. Helpful links for how to report on common
