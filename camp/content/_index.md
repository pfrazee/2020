## Information
Need a little more information before you sign up? Here are the basics:

### Why
There are a confluence of reasons for why you should be using these technologies today. Over the past few years in particular we have noticed a rise in demonetization, censorship, country-wide Internet shutdowns, and an explosion in privacy-invading technologies via ads and tracker analytics.
Attending the workshops over this event will give you the tools to publish your content your way.
(Also, these projects are just really cool and run by nice people.)

### Who
Aside from project leads representing the [Projects](/projects), there are also engineers, designers, journalists, hackers, and artists.

### What
Two days of immersive, hands-on workshops where you get to try out some of the latest web technologies for yourself and a Sunday Unconference where you get to learn of other projects in this space as well as show off what you made!

### When
May 29th - May 31st, 2020

### How
This is a purely online event, but if you want to set up a solar panel and a tent, we won't stop you. ðŸ˜‰

### Does it cost anything?
The event is totally free! We do ask that attendees register before the event though.
