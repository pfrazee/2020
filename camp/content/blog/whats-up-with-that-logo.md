One of the [community values]({{< ref "welcome-to-distributed-camp.md" >}}) is that "we're all participants".

The initial design of the logo is to imply autonomy with the opportunity for connection. Admittedly though, there is a lot of room for growth.

As one of our first pre-events, we're opening up the design of the logo to you.

Most of you should be able to spot the first easy fix (don't mix stylized fonts), but where will you take it from there?

Be sure to [register]({{< ref "_index.md" >}}) and we'll send you the next steps to join us in the process!
