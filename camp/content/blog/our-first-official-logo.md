As we mentioned in ["What's up with that logo?"]({{< ref "whats-up-with-that-logo.md" >}}), one of the [community values]({{< ref "welcome-to-distributed-camp.md" >}}) is that "we're all participants".

We held a Design Jam pre-event for our registered participants and came up with a really solid first logo!

We are so very pleased with all of the participation from campers and project leads, but an extra special shout-out is due to @ricky. Be sure to give them a cheer on our Discord server!
