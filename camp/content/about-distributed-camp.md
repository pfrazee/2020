If you wish to know more about the event, see [Welcome to Distributed Camp]({{< ref "blog/welcome-to-distributed-camp.md" >}})

Distributed Camp is a unique event produced by [Bimo Studio](https://bimo.studio)

It is a passion project of Bimo Studio to grow participation in technologies which are shaping the future of the Internet and to facilitate creators of all types.

The mechanics of how this event came to exist will be covered in one of the Sunday talks in the hopes that you (yes YOU) will grow the subsequent generations of camps for topics which are important to you.
